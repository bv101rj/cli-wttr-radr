Feel free to use this as you want. Just don't give it to the corpo's plz. 

As a note, you ARE going to need a single depend to get this working.

Its as easy as:

pacman -S mpv

If you are using anything other than Arch / Manjaro don't bother asking me. Its the year 2020. Just do your package managers install command followed by mpv pl0x.
